Naive Bayes 

 78 samples
637 predictors
  2 classes: 'CRC', 'HC' 

No pre-processing
Resampling: Cross-Validated (10 fold, repeated 3 times) 
Summary of sample sizes: 70, 69, 70, 71, 71, 70, ... 
Resampling results across tuning parameters:

  usekernel  Accuracy   Kappa    
  FALSE            NaN        NaN
   TRUE      0.7647487  0.5572641

Tuning parameter 'fL' was held constant at a value of 0
Tuning
 parameter 'adjust' was held constant at a value of 1
Accuracy was used to select the optimal model using the largest value.
The final values used for the model were fL = 0, usekernel = TRUE and adjust
 = 1.
