Naive Bayes 

 92 samples
685 predictors
  2 classes: 'HC', 'Lung' 

No pre-processing
Resampling: Cross-Validated (10 fold, repeated 3 times) 
Summary of sample sizes: 83, 84, 82, 84, 83, 82, ... 
Resampling results across tuning parameters:

  usekernel  Accuracy   Kappa    
  FALSE      0.8532407  0.7060694
   TRUE      0.8060185  0.6106486

Tuning parameter 'fL' was held constant at a value of 0
Tuning
 parameter 'adjust' was held constant at a value of 1
Accuracy was used to select the optimal model using the largest value.
The final values used for the model were fL = 0, usekernel = FALSE and adjust
 = 1.
