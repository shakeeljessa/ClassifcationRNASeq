README for knn.R

Function: runs fits for a given input subset.

IMPORTANT: RUN SCRIPT FROM MAIN CLASSIFICATION DIRECTORY
EX: Rscript KNN/knn.R <parameters>

Requirements:
getopt library
caret library
import.R script

Parameters:

-n : the input file name (given from the working directory as /classification/
ex: -n data/inputFile.csv
-o : the output file name (will generate three files in KNN/Predictions, KNN/ConfusionMatrices, and KNN/fits).
ex: -o breastCancer will output KNN/ClassifiedCounts/breastCancer.csv, KNN/ConfusionMatrices/breastCancer.txt, and KNN/fits/breastCancer.txt
-f : feature name, the name of the column index that has the statuses.
ex: if the column name was cancer_type, -f cancer_type
-s : (optional) the seed used for the k-nn algorithm. If none given, seed will be randomly generated by R.
-t : (optional) the tune length. will determine the number of k's that the algorithm will try. If none given, will try 10.

The input file must be a comma delimited file.
The input file must be a counts matrix with genes as the column index and samples as the row index.

The last column of the file must be the status of the sample (cancer/no cancer, etc, etc).

Will run k-nn algorithm and output a csv with the first column being the sample names, the second column being the real status, and the third column being the predicted status.
