CREDIT: Dhivya Arasappan for providing original script we modified to create this version of the script.

README for filter.R

IMPORTANT: RUN SCRIPT FROM classification/data DIRECTORY
EX Rscript scripts/generatingBatchVariances.R

Requirements:
tidyverse library
DESeq2 library
import.R script
BiocParallel (optional) - currently hardcoded to utilize 8 cores for DESeq2

Parameters:
none (currently hardcoded. will need to edit later)

The series annotations and counts matrix file must be tap delimited.
In the counts matrix, the row index must be genes and the column index must be samples.

It is recommended that the series annotations tsv is cut down to the necessary information, being the class type along with other relevant information.

The annotation file must have the analyzed characteristic defined as cancer_type for best functionality.

After running the script, run the following commands in terminal:
sed 's/,/\t/g' DESeq2-genes_affected_by_batch_LRT.csv|awk '{if ((($3>=2)||($3<=-2))&&($7<=0.01)) print $1}' > genes_affected_by_batch
sed 's/\"//g' genes_affected_by_batch -i
