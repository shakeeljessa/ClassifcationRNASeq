Naive Bayes 

 76 samples
674 predictors
  2 classes: 'Breast', 'HC' 

No pre-processing
Resampling: Cross-Validated (10 fold, repeated 3 times) 
Summary of sample sizes: 68, 69, 68, 69, 69, 68, ... 
Resampling results across tuning parameters:

  usekernel  Accuracy   Kappa    
  FALSE      0.9291667  0.8539625
   TRUE      0.8610450  0.7286413

Tuning parameter 'fL' was held constant at a value of 0
Tuning
 parameter 'adjust' was held constant at a value of 1
Accuracy was used to select the optimal model using the largest value.
The final values used for the model were fL = 0, usekernel = FALSE and adjust
 = 1.
